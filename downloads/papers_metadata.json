    "title": "Tumor biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and targeted therapy",
    "abstract": "Tumor biomarkers, the substances which are produced by tumors or the body\u2019s responses to tumors during tumorigenesis and progression, have been demonstrated to possess critical and encouraging value in screening and early diagnosis, prognosis prediction, recurrence detection, and therapeutic efficacy monitoring of cancers. Over the past decades, continuous progress has been made in exploring and discovering novel, sensitive, specific, and accurate tumor biomarkers, which has significantly promoted personalized medicine and improved the outcomes of cancer patients, especially advances in molecular biology technologies developed for the detection of tumor biomarkers. Herein, we summarize the discovery and development of tumor biomarkers, including the history of tumor biomarkers, the conventional and innovative technologies used for biomarker discovery and detection, the classification of tumor biomarkers based on tissue origins, and the application of tumor biomarkers in clinical cancer management. In particular, we highlight the recent advancements in biomarker-based anticancer-targeted therapies which are emerging as breakthroughs and promising cancer therapeutic strategies. We also discuss limitations and challenges that need to be addressed and provide insights and perspectives to turn challenges into opportunities in this field. Collectively, the discovery and application of multiple tumor biomarkers emphasized in this review may provide guidance on improved precision medicine, broaden horizons in future research directions, and expedite the clinical classification of cancer patients according to their molecular biomarkers rather than organs of origin.",

    "abstract": "The authors report a systematic analyses of blood biomarkers for metabolism against the whole spectrum of diseases in 100,000 individuals and reveals a prominent role of numerous metabolic biomarkers as risk markers beyond heart disease and diabetes. Blood lipids and metabolites are markers of current health and future disease risk. Here, we describe plasma nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) biomarker data for 118,461 participants in the UK Biobank. The biomarkers cover 249 measures of lipoprotein lipids, fatty acids, and small molecules such as amino acids, ketones, and glycolysis metabolites. We provide an atlas of associations of these biomarkers to prevalence, incidence, and mortality of over 700 common diseases ( nightingalehealth.com/atlas ). The results reveal a plethora of biomarker associations, including susceptibility to infectious diseases and risk of various cancers, joint disorders, and mental health outcomes, indicating that abundant circulating lipids and metabolites are risk markers beyond cardiometabolic diseases. Clustering analyses indicate similar biomarker association patterns across different disease types, suggesting latent systemic connectivity in the susceptibility to a diverse set of diseases. This work highlights the value of NMR based metabolic biomarker profiling in large biobanks for public health research and translation.",

    "title": "Small molecule metabolites: discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets",
    "abstract": "Metabolic abnormalities lead to the dysfunction of metabolic pathways and metabolite accumulation or deficiency which is well-recognized hallmarks of diseases. Metabolite signatures that have close proximity to subject\u2019s phenotypic informative dimension, are useful for predicting diagnosis and prognosis of diseases as well as monitoring treatments. The lack of early biomarkers could lead to poor diagnosis and serious outcomes. Therefore, noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring methods with high specificity and selectivity are desperately needed. Small molecule metabolites-based metabolomics has become a specialized tool for metabolic biomarker and pathway analysis, for revealing possible mechanisms of human various diseases and deciphering therapeutic potentials. It could help identify functional biomarkers related to phenotypic variation and delineate biochemical pathways changes as early indicators of pathological dysfunction and damage prior to disease development. Recently, scientists have established a large number of metabolic profiles to reveal the underlying mechanisms and metabolic networks for therapeutic target exploration in biomedicine. This review summarized the metabolic analysis on the potential value of small-molecule candidate metabolites as biomarkers with clinical events, which may lead to better diagnosis, prognosis, drug screening and treatment. We also discuss challenges that need to be addressed to fuel the next wave of breakthroughs.",

    "title": "Biomarkers of aging",
    "abstract": "Aging biomarkers are a combination of biological parameters to (i) assess age-related changes, (ii) track the physiological aging process, and (iii) predict the transition into a pathological status. Although a broad spectrum of aging biomarkers has been developed, their potential uses and limitations remain poorly characterized. An immediate goal of biomarkers is to help us answer the following three fundamental questions in aging research: How old are we? Why do we get old? And how can we age slower? This review aims to address this need. Here, we summarize our current knowledge of biomarkers developed for cellular, organ, and organismal levels of aging, comprising six pillars: physiological characteristics, medical imaging, histological features, cellular alterations, molecular changes, and secretory factors. To fulfill all these requisites, we propose that aging biomarkers should qualify for being specific, systemic, and clinically relevant.",

    "title": "How to use biomarkers of infection or sepsis at the bedside: guide to clinicians",
    "abstract": "Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In this context, biomarkers could be considered as indicators of either infection or dysregulated host response or response to treatment and/or aid clinicians to prognosticate patient risk. More than 250 biomarkers have been identified and evaluated over the last few decades, but no biomarker accurately differentiates between sepsis and sepsis-like syndrome. Published data support the use of biomarkers for pathogen identification, clinical diagnosis, and optimization of antibiotic treatment. In this narrative review, we highlight how clinicians could improve the use of pathogen-specific and of the most used host-response biomarkers, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, to improve the clinical care of patients with sepsis. Biomarker kinetics are more useful than single values in predicting sepsis, when making the diagnosis and assessing the response to antibiotic therapy. Finally, integrated biomarker-guided algorithms may hold promise to improve both the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis. Herein, we provide current data on the clinical utility of pathogen-specific and host-response biomarkers, offer guidance on how to optimize their use, and propose the needs for future research.",

    "abstract": "Mining immunotherapy clinical trials Clinical trial data can provide a wealth of information about how drugs work. Yet such information often belongs to pharmaceutical companies and is rarely accessible to the scientific community at large. Cristescu et al. provide exploratory analysis of a cancer genomics dataset, collected from four separate clinical trials of Merck's PD-1 immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab. This informative public resource examines more than 300 patient samples representing 22 different tumor types. Two widely used signatures that currently predict immunotherapy response are tumor mutational burden and a \u201chot\u201d T cell\u2013inflamed microenvironment. The study analyzed these two proposed biomarkers in combination to see what predictive clinical utility they may hold. Science, this issue p. eaar3593 Genomic biomarkers will help to elucidate which cancer patients will benefit from PD-1 blockade immunotherapy. INTRODUCTION Immunotherapy targeting the programmed cell death protein\u20131 (PD-1) axis elicits durable antitumor responses in multiple cancer types. However, clinical responses vary, and biomarkers predictive of response may help to identify patients who will derive the greatest therapeutic benefit. Clinically validated biomarkers predictive of response to the anti\u2013PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab include PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in specific cancers and high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) regardless of tumor type. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and T cell\u2013inflamed gene expression profile (GEP) are emerging predictive biomarkers for pembrolizumab. Both PD-L1 and GEP are inflammatory biomarkers indicative of a T cell\u2013inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME), whereas TMB and MSI-H are indirect measures of tumor antigenicity generated by somatic tumor mutations. However, the relationship between these two categories of biomarkers is not well characterized. RATIONALE This study assessed the potential for TMB and a T cell\u2013inflamed GEP to jointly predict clinical response to pembrolizumab in >300 patient samples with advanced solid tumors and melanoma across 22 tumor types from four KEYNOTE clinical trials. To assess the individual and joint clinical utility of TMB and GEP, patients were stratified in four biomarker-defined clinical response groups [GEP low and TMB low (GEPlo TMBlo), GEP low and TMB high (GEPlo TMBhi), GEPhi TMBlo, and GEPhi TMBhi] based on predefined cutoffs for TMB and GEP. These patient-defined biomarker groups were further used to guide transcriptome and exome analyses of tumors in a large molecular database [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)] (n = 6384 tumors) to identify targetable patterns of biology that may modulate response and resistance. RESULTS TMB and GEP exhibited only modest correlation and were independently predictive of response across the KEYNOTE clinical datasets. We found that objective response rates were strongest in patients with GEPhi TMBhi (37 to 57%), moderate in those with GEPhi TMBlo (12 to 35%) and GEPlo TMBhi (11 to 42%), and reduced or absent in those with GEPlo TMBlo (0 to 9%) (see the figure). Additionally, longer progression-free survival times were seen in patients with higher levels of both TMB and GEP. Findings were comparable when TMB and PD-L1 expression were jointly assessed. Within TCGA database, GEP and TMB again had a low correlation, demonstrating the potential to jointly stratify transcriptomic and genomic features across cancer types. Specific gene expression patterns reflective of TME biology showed significant associations with TMB, GEP, or both. In particular, gene set enrichment analysis identified proliferative and stromal, myeloid, and vascular biology corresponding to specific TMB-defined subgroups within GEPhi tumors. In TMBhi tumors, indication-dependent somatic DNA alterations in key cancer driver genes showed a strong negative association with GEP. CONCLUSION This analysis shows that TMB and inflammatory biomarkers (T cell\u2013inflamed GEP and PD-L1 expression) can jointly stratify human cancers into groups with different clinical responses to pembrolizumab monotherapy and identify patterns of underlying, targetable biology related to these groups. TMB and inflammatory biomarkers independently predict response and may capture distinct features of neoantigenicity and T cell activation, respectively. This approach may provide a precision medicine framework for rationally constructing and evaluating anti\u2013PD-1\u2013 and/or \u2013PD-L1\u2013based combination therapy regimens. Biomarker-defined responses to pembrolizumab monotherapy identify targetable-resistance biology. (A) Tumors have low TMB and low neoantigenicity and lack a T cell\u2013inflamed TME. (B) Tumors can evade the immune response despite high TMB and high neoantigenicity. (C) Although T cells are present, stromal and/or endothelial factors in the TME, low TMB, and low neoantigenicity impede their activity. (D) Tumors have high TMB, high neoantigenicity, and a T cell\u2013inflamed TME, typified by activated T cells and other immune cells with cytolytic roles. Programmed cell death protein\u20131 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand\u20131 (PD-L1) checkpoint blockade immunotherapy elicits durable antitumor effects in multiple cancers, yet not all patients respond. We report the evaluation of >300 patient samples across 22 tumor types from four KEYNOTE clinical trials. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and a T cell\u2013inflamed gene expression profile (GEP) exhibited joint predictive utility in identifying responders and nonresponders to the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab. TMB and GEP were independently predictive of response and demonstrated low correlation, suggesting that they capture distinct features of neoantigenicity and T cell activation. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database showed TMB and GEP to have a low correlation, and analysis by joint stratification revealed biomarker-defined patterns of targetable-resistance biology. These biomarkers may have utility in clinical trial design by guiding rational selection of anti\u2013PD-1 monotherapy and combination immunotherapy regimens.",

    "title": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors: recent progress and potential biomarkers",
    "abstract": "Cancer growth and progression are associated with immune suppression. Cancer cells have the ability to activate different immune checkpoint pathways that harbor immunosuppressive functions. Monoclonal antibodies that target immune checkpoints provided an immense breakthrough in cancer therapeutics. Among the immune checkpoint inhibitors, PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors showed promising therapeutic outcomes, and some have been approved for certain cancer treatments, while others are under clinical trials. Recent reports have shown that patients with various malignancies benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. However, mainstream initiation of immune checkpoint therapy to treat cancers is obstructed by the low response rate and immune-related adverse events in some cancer patients. This has given rise to the need for developing sets of biomarkers that predict the response to immune checkpoint blockade and immune-related adverse events. In this review, we discuss different predictive biomarkers for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 inhibitors, including immune cells, PD-L1 overexpression, neoantigens, and genetic and epigenetic signatures. Potential approaches for further developing highly reliable predictive biomarkers should facilitate patient selection for and decision-making related to immune checkpoint inhibitor-based therapies. Biomarkers that predict a patient\u2019s response to cancer immunotherapy are being developed, and may allow individual tailoring of therapies. Cancer cells can suppress the immune system by activating immune checkpoints, signals that stop the immune system from attacking the host. Immunotherapy, a recently developed treatment, inactivates immune checkpoints, restoring the patient\u2019s immune response against the tumor. Although promising, immunotherapy has a low response rate, and sometimes triggers severe auto-immune reactions. Eyad Elkord at Qatar Biomedical Research Institute in Qatar and coworkers have reviewed biomarkers that could be used to predict individual effects of immunotherapy, identifying nonresponders and preventing adverse immune reactions. They discuss markers based on factors such as immune response level and individual tumor genetics, among others. With further research and testing, these biomarkers could improve the efficacy of this promising new cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "A biomarker describes a measurable indicator of a patient's clinical condition that can be measured accurately and reproducibly. Biomarkers offer utility for diagnosis, prognosis, early disease recognition, risk stratification, appropriate treatment (theranostics), and trial enrichment for patients with sepsis or suspected sepsis. In this narrative review, we aim to answer the question, \"Do biomarkers in patients with sepsis or septic shock predict mortality, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), or organ dysfunction?\" We also discuss the role of pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and biomarkers associated with intestinal permeability, endothelial injury, organ dysfunction, blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, brain injury, and short and long-term mortality. For sepsis, a range of biomarkers is identified, including fluid phase pattern recognition molecules (PRMs), complement system, cytokines, chemokines, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), non-coding RNAs, miRNAs, cell membrane receptors, cell proteins, metabolites, and soluble receptors. We also provide an overview of immune response biomarkers that can help identify or differentiate between systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, septic shock, and sepsis-associated encephalopathy. However, significant work is needed to identify the optimal combinations of biomarkers that can augment diagnosis, treatment, and good patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Molecular cancer biomarkers are any measurable molecular indicator of risk of cancer, occurrence of cancer, or patient outcome. They may include germline or somatic genetic variants, epigenetic signatures, transcriptional changes, and proteomic signatures. These indicators are based on biomolecules, such as nucleic acids and proteins, that can be detected in samples obtained from tissues through tumor biopsy or, more easily and non-invasively, from blood (or serum or plasma), saliva, buccal swabs, stool, urine, etc. Detection technologies have advanced tremendously over the last decades, including techniques such as next-generation sequencing, nanotechnology, or methods to study circulating tumor DNA/RNA or exosomes. Clinical applications of biomarkers are extensive. They can be used as tools for cancer risk assessment, screening and early detection of cancer, accurate diagnosis, patient prognosis, prediction of response to therapy, and cancer surveillance and monitoring response. Therefore, they can help to optimize making decisions in clinical practice. Moreover, precision oncology is needed for newly developed targeted therapies, as they are functional only in patients with specific cancer genetic mutations, and biomarkers are the tools used for the identification of these subsets of patients. Improvement in the field of cancer biomarkers is, however, needed to overcome the scientific challenge of developing new biomarkers with greater sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predisposes patients to thrombotic and thromboembolic events, owing to excessive inflammation, endothelial cell activation and injury, platelet activation and hypercoagulability. Patients with COVID-19 have a prothrombotic or thrombophilic state, with elevations in the levels of several biomarkers of thrombosis, which are associated with disease severity and prognosis. Although some biomarkers of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, including high levels of fibrinogen and d-dimer, were recognized early during the pandemic, many new biomarkers of thrombotic risk in COVID-19 have emerged. In this Consensus Statement, we delineate the thrombotic signature of COVID-19 and present the latest biomarkers and platforms to assess the risk of thrombosis in these patients, including markers of platelet activation, platelet aggregation, endothelial cell activation or injury, coagulation and fibrinolysis as well as biomarkers of the newly recognized post-vaccine thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. We then make consensus recommendations for the clinical use of these biomarkers to inform prognosis, assess disease acuity, and predict thrombotic risk and in-hospital mortality. A thorough understanding of these biomarkers might aid risk stratification and prognostication, guide interventions and provide a platform for future research. In this Consensus Statement, the authors delineate the thrombotic signature of COVID-19 and present the latest biomarkers and platforms to assess thrombotic risk in these patients. Consensus recommendations are made about the clinical use of these biomarkers to inform prognosis, assess disease acuity, and predict thrombosis and in-hospital mortality.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), recently renamed metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), is one of the most common causes of liver diseases worldwide. NAFLD is growing in parallel with the obesity epidemic. No pharmacological treatment is available to treat NAFLD, specifically. The reason might be that NAFLD is a multi-factorial disease with an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms involved, an absence of accurate and inexpensive imaging tools, and lack of adequate non-invasive biomarkers. NAFLD consists of the accumulation of excess lipids in the liver, causing lipotoxicity that might progress to metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The mechanisms for the pathogenesis of NAFLD, current interventions in the management of the disease, and the role of sirtuins as potential targets for treatment are discussed here. In addition, the current diagnostic tools, and the role of non-coding RNAs as emerging diagnostic biomarkers are summarized. The availability of non-invasive biomarkers, and accurate and inexpensive non-invasive diagnosis tools are crucial in the detection of the early signs in the progression of NAFLD. This will expedite clinical trials and the validation of the emerging therapeutic treatments.",

Here, we unite and update these methodologies into one R package (oncoPredict) to facilitate the development and adoption of these tools.

    "abstract": "genome are dramatically reshaping the research and development pathways for drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. The growth in the number of molecular entities entering the drug development pipeline has accelerated as a consequence of powerful discovery and screening technologies such as combinatorial chemistry, mass spectrometry, high throughput screening, celland tissue-based DNA microarrays, and proteomic approaches.1 As a consequence, there is an escalating number of therapeutic candidates, which has caused the need for new technologies and strategies to streamline the process to make safe and effective therapies available to patients. One approach to the achievement of more expeditious and informative therapeutic research is the use of precise clinical measurement tools to determine disease progression and the effects of interventions (drugs, surgery, and vaccines). For example, gene-based approaches such as single nucleotide polymorphism maps are now being developed to distinguish the molecular and cellular basis for variations in clinical response to therapy.2 Another approach is the use of a wide array of analytical tools to assess biological parameters, which are referred to as biomarkers. Biomarker measurements can help explain empirical results of clinical trials by relating the effects of interventions on molecular and cellular pathways to clinical responses. In doing so, biomarkers provide an avenue for researchers to gain a mechanistic understanding of the differences in clinical response that may be influenced by uncontrolled variables (for example, drug metabolism). There are a variety of ways that biomarker measurements can aid in the development and evaluation of COMMENTARY",

    "title": "miRNAs as Biomarkers in Disease: Latest Findings Regarding Their Role in Diagnosis and Prognosis",
    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of small, non-coding RNAs with the main roles of regulating mRNA through its degradation and adjusting protein levels. In recent years, extraordinary progress has been made in terms of identifying the origin and exact functions of miRNA, focusing on their potential use in both the research and the clinical field. This review aims at improving the current understanding of these molecules and their applicability in the medical field. A thorough analysis of the literature consulting resources available in online databases such as NCBI, PubMed, Medline, ScienceDirect, and UpToDate was performed. There is promising evidence that in spite of the lack of standardized protocols regarding the use of miRNAs in current clinical practice, they constitute a reliable tool for future use. These molecules meet most of the required criteria for being an ideal biomarker, such as accessibility, high specificity, and sensitivity. Despite present limitations, miRNAs as biomarkers for various conditions remain an impressive research field. As current techniques evolve, we anticipate that miRNAs will become a routine approach in the development of personalized patient profiles, thus permitting more specific therapeutic interventions.",
