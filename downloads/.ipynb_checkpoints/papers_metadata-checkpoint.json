    "title": "The Most Current Algorithms for the Treatment and Prevention of Hypertrophic Scars and Keloids: A 2020 Update of the Algorithms Published 10 Years Ago",
    "abstract": "Background: In 2010, this Journal published my comprehensive review of the literature on hypertrophic scars and keloids. In that article, I presented evidence-based algorithms for the prevention and treatment of these refractory pathologic scars. In the ensuing decade, substantial progress has been made in the field, including many new randomized controlled trials. To reflect this, I have updated my review. Methods: All studies were evaluated for methodologic quality. Baseline characteristics of patients were extracted along with the interventions and their outcomes. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and comprehensive reviews were included if available. Results: Risk factors that promote hypertrophic scar and keloid growth include local factors (tension on the wound/scar), systemic factors (e.g., hypertension), genetic factors (e.g., single-nucleotide polymorphisms), and lifestyle factors. Treatment of hypertrophic scars depends on scar contracture severity: if severe, surgery is the first choice. If not, conservative therapies are indicated. Keloid treatment depends on whether they are small and single or large and multiple. Small and single keloids can be treated radically by surgery with adjuvant therapy (e.g., radiotherapy) or multimodal conservative therapy. For large and multiple keloids, volume- and number-reducing surgery is a choice. Regardless of the treatment(s), patients should be followed up over the long term. Conservative therapies, including gel sheets, tape fixation, topical and injected external agents, oral agents, and makeup therapy, should be administered on a case-by-case basis. Conclusions: Randomized controlled trials on pathologic scar management have increased markedly over the past decade. Although these studies suffer from various limitations, they have greatly improved hypertrophic scar and keloid management. Future high-quality trials are likely to improve the current hypertrophic scar and keloid treatment algorithms further.",

    "title": "Keloids and Hypertrophic Scars: Pathophysiology, Classification, and Treatment",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Keloid and hypertrophic scars represent an aberrant response to the wound healing process. These scars are characterized by dysregulated growth with excessive collagen formation, and can be cosmetically and functionally disruptive to patients. OBJECTIVE Objectives are to describe the pathophysiology of keloid and hypertrophic scar, and to compare differences with the normal wound healing process. The classification of keloids and hypertrophic scars are then discussed. Finally, various treatment options including prevention, conventional therapies, surgical therapies, and adjuvant therapies are described in detail. MATERIALS AND METHODS Literature review was performed identifying relevant publications pertaining to the pathophysiology, classification, and treatment of keloid and hypertrophic scars. RESULTS Though the pathophysiology of keloid and hypertrophic scars is not completely known, various cytokines have been implicated, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10, as well as various growth factors including transforming growth factor-beta and platelet-derived growth factor. Numerous treatments have been studied for keloid and hypertrophic scars,which include conventional therapies such as occlusive dressings, compression therapy, and steroids; surgical therapies such as excision and cryosurgery; and adjuvant and emerging therapies including radiation therapy, interferon, 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, tacrolimus, sirolimus, bleomycin, doxorubicin, transforming growth factor-beta, epidermal growth factor, verapamil, retinoic acid, tamoxifen, botulinum toxin A, onion extract, silicone-based camouflage, hydrogel scaffold, and skin tension offloading device. CONCLUSION Keloid and hypertrophic scars remain a challenging condition, with potential cosmetic and functional consequences to patients. Several therapies exist which function through different mechanisms. Better understanding into the pathogenesis will allow for development of newer and more targeted therapies in the future.",

    "title": "Macrophages of the M1 and M2 types play a role in keloids pathogenesis",
    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of keloid formation is unknown, however, macrophages are thought to play a role in keloid formation. Understanding the mechanism(s) of keloid development might be crucial in developing a new treatment regimen for keloids. The aim of this study was to understand possible status of M1 and M2 type macrophages in the pathogenesis of keloid. Thirty cases of Keloid tissues were selected according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as 30 normal scars, were enrolled in our study as a control group. An excisional biopsy was harvested and ELISA was done on keloid tissue and normal scar samples, with CD68, the surface marker for M1 and CD163 representing M2. The results revealed the low expression of M1 (CD68) in keloid tissue meanwhile high levels of M1 were detected in normal scars. We also detected that higher tissue expression of M2 (CD163) was significantly associated with keloid cases when compared to low M2 expression in the control group. An important finding that was discovered during our study is that the M1 and M2 are significant predictors of keloid. Every increase of 1\u2009ng/mL in M1 decreases the risk of keloid by 0.99 while every increase of one unit in M2 increases the risk of keloid by 2.01. This study concluded that the keloid formation could be a result of an abnormal response to tissue injury where there is an excessive entry of inflammatory cells into the wound, including macrophages and that the keloid incidence might be related to a decrease in M1 and an increase in M2.",

    "title": "Risk factors associated with the progression from keloids to severe keloids",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Keloids are benign fibrous growths that are caused by excessive tissue build-up. Severe keloids exert more significant effects on patients\u2019 quality of life than do mild keloids. We aimed to identify factors associated with the progression from mild keloids to severe keloids, as distinct from those associated with the formation of keloids. Methods: In this retrospective case-control study, 251 patients diagnosed with keloids at West China Hospital between November 2018 and April 2021 were grouped according to the severity of lesions (mild [n\u200a=\u200a162] or severe [n\u200a=\u200a89]). We collected their basic characteristics, living habits, incomes, comorbidities, and keloid characteristics from Electronic Medical Records in the hospital and the patients\u2019 interviews. Conditional multivariable regression was performed to identify the independent risk factors for the progression of keloids. Results: Eighty-nine patients (35.5%) were classified as having severe keloids. We found the distribution of severe keloids varied with sex, age, excessive scrubbing of keloids, family income, the comorbidity of rheumatism, disease duration, characteristics of the location, location in sites of high-stretch tension, the severity and frequency of pain, the severity of pruritus, and infection. Multivariable analysis revealed significant associations between severe keloids and infection (odds ratio [OR], 3.55; P\u200a=\u200a0.005), excessive scrubbing of keloids (OR, 8.65; P\u200a=\u200a0.001), low or middle family income (OR, 13.44; P\u200a=\u200a0.021), comorbidity of rheumatism (OR, 18.97; P\u200a=\u200a0.021), multiple keloids located at multiple sites (OR, 3.18; P\u200a=\u200a0.033), and disease duration\u200a>\u200a15 years (OR, 2.98; P\u200a=\u200a0.046). Conclusion: Doctors should implement more active and thorough measures to minimize the progression of mild keloids in patients who have any of the following risk factors: infection, excessive scrubbing of keloids, low or middle family income, comorbidity of rheumatism, multiple keloids located at multiple sites, and disease duration >\u200a15 years.",

    "title": "Hypertrophic scars and keloids: Overview of the evidence and practical guide for differentiating between these abnormal scars",
    "abstract": "Although hypertrophic scars and keloids both generate excessive scar tissue, keloids are characterized by their extensive growth beyond the borders of the original wound, which is not observed in hypertrophic scars. Whether or not hypertrophic scars and keloids are two sides of the same coin or in fact distinct entities remains a topic of much debate. However, proper comparison between the two ideally occurs within the same study, but this is the exception rather than the rule. For this reason, the goal of this review was to summarize and evaluate all publications in which both hypertrophic scars and keloids were studied and compared to one another within the same study. The presence of horizontal growth is the mainstay of the keloid diagnosis and remains the strongest argument in support of keloids and hypertrophic scars being distinct entities, and the histopathological distinction is less straightforward. Keloidal collagen remains the strongest keloid parameter, but dermal nodules and \u03b1\u2010SMA immunoreactivity are not limited to hypertrophic scars alone. Ultimately, the current hypertrophic scars\u2010keloid differences are mostly quantitative in nature rather than qualitative, and many similar abnormalities exist in both lesions. Nonetheless, the presence of similarities does not equate the absence of fundamental differences, some of which may not yet have been uncovered given how much we still have to learn about the processes involved in normal wound healing. It therefore seems pertinent to continue treating hypertrophic scars and keloids as separate entities, until such a time as new findings more decisively convinces us otherwise.",

    "title": "Diagnosis and Treatment of Keloids and Hypertrophic Scars\u2014Japan Scar Workshop Consensus Document 2018",
    "abstract": "There has been a long-standing need for guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars that are based on an understanding of the pathomechanisms that underlie these skin fibrotic diseases. This is particularly true for clinicians who deal with Asian and African patients because these ethnicities are highly prone to these diseases. By contrast, Caucasians are less likely to develop keloids and hypertrophic scars, and if they do, the scars tend not to be severe. This ethnic disparity also means that countries vary in terms of their differential diagnostic algorithms. The lack of clear treatment guidelines also means that primary care physicians are currently applying a hotchpotch of treatments, with uneven outcomes. To overcome these issues, the Japan Scar Workshop (JSW) has created a tool that allows clinicians to objectively diagnose and distinguish between keloids, hypertrophic scars, and mature scars. This tool is called the JSW Scar Scale (JSS) and it involves scoring the risk factors of the individual patients and the affected areas. The tool is simple and easy to use. As a result, even physicians who are not accustomed to keloids and hypertrophic scars can easily diagnose them and judge their severity. The JSW has also established a committee that, in cooperation with outside experts in various fields, has prepared a Consensus Document on keloid and hypertrophic scar treatment guidelines. These guidelines are simple and will allow even inexperienced clinicians to choose the most appropriate treatment strategy. The Consensus Document is provided in this article. It describes (1) the diagnostic algorithm for pathological scars and how to differentiate them from clinically similar benign and malignant tumors, (2) the general treatment algorithms for keloids and hypertrophic scars at different medical facilities, (3) the rationale behind each treatment for keloids and hypertrophic scars, and (4) the body site-specific treatment protocols for these scars. We believe that this Consensus Document will be helpful for physicians from all over the world who treat keloids and hypertrophic scars.",
